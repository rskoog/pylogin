# pylogin
A python utility similar to RANCID's clogin.

I recently ran into an issue where I needed to push changes to a lot of devices that didn't have a prompt any 
existing utility would recognize.  After finding the paramiko-expect library by fgimian, I decided to make a utility similar
to clogin, but that would easily allow the user to specify different prompts to match.  It does require a pythyon version
of at least 2.7.


Usage:
[skoog@bounty pylogin]$ ./pylogin.py --help
usage: pylogin.py [-h] [-c COMMAND] [-p PASSWORD] [-prompt PROMPT]
                  [-pagerprompt PAGERPROMPT]
                  [-enablepassprompt ENABLEPASSPROMPT]
                  [-enablepass ENABLEPASS] [-t TIMEOUT] [-u USERNAME]
                  [-x COMMANDFILE]
                  router [router ...]

pylogin a python script with expect prompt handling and behavior similar to
rancid's clogin

positional arguments:

                        line. Multiple commands maybe listed by separating
                        them with semi-colons (;)
  -p PASSWORD           Password to be used for the device. The script will
                        prompt if not given one.
  -prompt PROMPT        Prompt that pylogin should expect for a new line,
                        defaults to Cisco IOS like.
  -pagerprompt PAGERPROMPT
                        Prompt given by pager if enabled, defaults to Cisco
                        IOS like.
  -enablepassprompt ENABLEPASSPROMPT
                        Password prompt given by the device when the enable
                        command is sent. The default is cisco ios compatible.
  -enablepass ENABLEPASS
                        Enable password, defaults to the same as password.
  -t TIMEOUT            Time pylogin should allow to connect to the device.
  -u USERNAME           Username to be used for the device, defaults to
                        current user.
  -x COMMANDFILE        Specifies a file with commands to run on each device.
                        Theymust not expect additional input. This option
                        overrides -c

Example Usage with a Sentry Commander PDU device:

[skoog@bounty pylogin]$ ./pylogin.py -c 'show syslog' -prompt 'Switched CDU: ' 
Password:


Sentry Switched CDU Version 6.1e

Location: Your-House

Switched CDU: show syslog

   SYSLOG Configuration

      Primary Host:    1.1.1.1
      Secondary Host:
      Port:            514

   Command successful

Switched CDU: exit

Session ended

Or you can just use it with a cisco router.
